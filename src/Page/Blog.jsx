            <li className='text-2xl mt-7 mx-34'>
Many of us ask, "I got a decent salary, so why is my wallet empty at the end of the month?" The main culprit is often the small, uncounted expenses. Daily rickshaw fares, tea breaks, or impulse snacks adds up to a large amount over time. Tracking expenses isn't about being stingy; it's about having control. Record every transaction in FinEase and discover exactly where your money flows.</li>

            <li className='text-2xl mt-7 mx-34'>Struggling to create a budget? Try the famous 50/30/20 rule.

Use the budgeting feature in FinEase to easily categorize your spending and stick to this golden rule of financial health.</li>

        <li className='text-2xl mt-7 mx-34'>Life is unpredictable. Medical emergencies or sudden job loss never come with a warning. That is why experts recommend having an 'Emergency Fund' covering at least 3 to 6 months of living expenses. Don't wait for a crisis—set a 'Savings Goal' in FinEase today and start building your safety net, one small deposit at a time.</li>

        <li className='text-2xl mt-7 mx-34'>Student life often means limited income but endless expenses—photocopies, books, and mobile data. However, saving is possible if you act smart. Walk short distances instead of taking a rickshaw, use student discounts, or skip expensive coffee for campus tea. At the end of the month, these small savings will help you afford that gadget or trip you've been dreaming of.</li>

        <li className='text-2xl mt-7 mx-34'>Does hanging out with friends always end with an empty wallet? Food bills are the biggest expense for students. You don't have to stop socializing—just change how you spend. Pick affordable spots over fancy cafes, or normalize 'Dutch' (splitting the bill) among friends. Set a monthly 'Entertainment' budget in FinEase and try not to cross the limit.</li>

        <h2 className='text-4xl font-bold mx-16 mt-20 flex items-center gap-7'><FaRegHandPointRight />Master Your Money Before You Graduate</h2>

        <li className='text-2xl mt-7 mx-34'>Many students think, "I'll start managing money when I get a job." This is a mistake. Financial responsibility is a habit, not a switch. If you cannot manage a tuition salary of 5,000 Taka effectively, you will struggle to manage a salary of 50,000 Taka later. Start using FinEase now to build the habit of tracking income and expenses early in your career.</li>
